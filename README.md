# Classification-with-Python
Objectiv: Solve Classification Problems and predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not

Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Here we used data from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Here we useed the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
